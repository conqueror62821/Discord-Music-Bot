## Usage

**Requires [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) version 14.x or above.**

1. Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) first
2. Rename `.env.schema` to `.env` and fill out the values (example on `.env.example`)
3. Install dependencies as stated [here](https://github.com/zhycorp/disc-11#installation)
4. Run `npm run build` using Node Package Manager
5. Optional thing, prune dev dependencies (this is good to save disk spaces):
```sh
$ npm prune --production
```
1. Start it with `npm start` and you're done!

Notes: 
1. You only need to configure `.env` file when you're using the [Docker image](https://github.com/zhycorp/disc-11#Docker)
2. If you're using **Deploy to Heroku** button, you don't need to do this.

## Installation

Without optional packages:
```sh
$ npm install --no-optional
```

With optional packages (recommended):
```sh
$ npm install
```
For optional packages, you need to install build tools as stated [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) and you also need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
